            <p class="col-8">Paris is a diverse and sophisticated city that appeals to the wealthy but can also be
                enjoyed on a budget. In addition to the Eiffel Tower, Paris has countless other gorgeous landmarks and
                monuments that add to the beauty of the spacious boulevards and their charming cafés.
                French cuisine is also world-famous, and you can find some of the best of it in Paris. There is
                world-class shopping and a dynamic fashion scene, and plenty of interesting museums and art galleries.
                Just outside Paris, there are plenty of fun day trips to take for further insight into the culture and
                history of France.</p>
